## Arguments

On [Day 01](../day_01/day_01.md) we learned [queries](../day_01/day_01.md#query) and [resolvers](../day_01/day_01.md#resolver)., and we also learned how to ask for a subset of scalars from a given object (or each one of a list of objects). But what if we want to request a specific subset of records based on its values (filtering) or tell the server to perform a specific data transformation on a specific field? Here's where `arguments` comes into play.

Imagine a scenario where the underlying persistence system returns a collection of rows, we usually filter with a URL query string param on a REST request.

Given the following request:

```txt
<scheme>://<authority>/characters/?age=40
```

We expect a response with characters being `40`, filtering out the rest.

How does GraphQL provide that functionality?

| come again?  (ಠ_ಠ)  |
|:-:|
|All `Object Type`.`fields` will eventually be mapped to `resolver functions` and therefore, will accept arguments. _(including default `Root Operation` object [Query](http://spec.graphql.org/June2018/#sec-Query), [Mutation](http://spec.graphql.org/June2018/#sec-Mutation) and [Subscription](http://spec.graphql.org/June2018/#sec-Subscription) since they are [Object Types](http://spec.graphql.org/June2018/#sec-Objects) as well)_ |

### Simple example

For the given typeDef

```graphql
type Character {
  name: String
  surname: String
  age: Int
}

type Query {
  characters: [Character]
}
```

.. let's try this query

```graphql
query {
  characters (age: 40) {
    name
    surname
    age ## just to make sure :P
  }
}
```

BOOM! 💥 `"Unknown argument "age" on field "characters" of type "Query"."`

That's GraphQL saying: **You can't pass no args if you ain't got no Type Def!**

Everything MUST be declared on your Type Definition.

```graphql
type Query {
  characters (age: Int): [Character]
}
```

Of course, passing the param along without handling it at resolver level won't do the job.

```javascript
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    characters (obj, params, context, info) {
      return context.db.findCharacter({ age: params.age })
    }
  }
}
```

### Arguments, deep dive

SUPER POWERS ON ─=≡Σ((( つ◕ل͜◕)つ

Before diving deeper it'd be great to have some starting point definitions and reminders so that we don't get lost and confused.

1. Any field of a `query`, `mutation` or `subscription` operation can pass `arguments` along
2. Any field of an `Object Type` can pass `arguments` along
3. Every `argument` of an operation MUST be declared on the Type Definition
4. `argument` names MUST NOT begin with "__" (double underscore), that naming convention is reserved for GraphQL's introspection system
5. `argument` names in an argument set for a field MUST be **unique**
6. `arguments` are **unordered**
7. `argument` values are **typed** and they MUST belong to a known type on the Type Definition as long as they're valid [input types](http://spec.graphql.org/June2018/#sec-Input-and-Output-Types), they being one of the default set of types or a custom type.
8. `arguments` can be `non-nullable` (aka required)
9. `arguments` can have a default value

#### Nested query and field level arguments

So far, we've seen nothing worthy of the "legendary mighty awesomeness of arguments usage" award. That's about to change, like, forever.

What if we need to get a specific subset of records with a specific subset of related records like the following:

> get all characters names whose kind is "hobbit" and whose homeland is "The Shire" and their friends names whose kind is "half-elven" and the progenitor whose skill is "foresight".

In a typical REST API we would do:

```txt
> request: /characters/?homeland=The%20Shire

// for each result
> request: /characters/?id=<list of friends ids>&kind=half-elven

// for each result
> request: /characters/?id=<list of progenitor ids>&skill=foresight

// connect all results on the client side

```

And this is a silly example of querying the characters endpoint with 3 different filters!!! Can you imagine a really complex relationship of data being asked to the server with multiple requests and handling those relationships on the client with a ton of garbage data and handling the business logic to orchestrate which method should be called in which order passing which params and validating all inputs?

Sure, you could define an ad-hoc endpoint for that but throwing scalability and maintainability overboard in the process.

In GraphQL the <span id="nested-query-with-arguments">nested query with arguments</span> would go:

```graphql
query {
  characters (homeland: "The Shire") {
    name
    friends (kind: "half-elven") {
      name
      progenitor (skill: "foresight") {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Now, let's see how the Type definition might go for the previous operation.

```graphql
type Character {
  name: String
  homeland: String
  kind: String
  friends (kind: String): [Character!]
  progenitor (skill: String): [Character!]
  skill: String
}

type Query {
  characters (homeland: String): [Character]
}
```

and the resolvers would go:

```javascript

// Note:
// Filtering functions names are made up for explanatory purpose

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    /**
     * interested only in
     *  -> homeland property of the second arg (params)
     */
    characters(obj, { homeland }) {
      return context.db
        .addFilter({ homeland })
        .fetchCharacters();
    }
  },
  Character: {
    /**
     * interested only in
     *  -> friends property of the first arg (obj)
     * and
     *  -> kind property of the second arg (params)
     */
    friends({ friends }, { kind }) {
      return context.db
        .addFilter({ friends })
        .addFilter({ kind })
        .fetchCharacters();
    },
    /**
     * interested only in
     *  -> progenitor property of the first arg (obj)
     * and
     *  -> skill property of the second arg (params)
     */
    progenitor({ progenitor }, { skill }) {
      return context.db
        .addFilter({ progenitor })
        .addFilter({ skill })
        .fetchCharacters();
    }
  }
}
```

and the response might look like:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "characters": [
      {
        "name": "Frodo",
        "friends": [
          {
            "name": "Arwen",
            "progenitor": [
              {
                "name": "Elrond"
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "name": "Sam",
        "friends": []
      },
      {
        "name": "Peregrin",
        "friends": []
      },
      {
        "name": "Meriadoc",
        "friends": []
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

We defined:

- 3 params
  - 1 for the top-level query
    - `characters`
      - `(homeland: String)`
  - 2 for the field-level queries
    - `friends`
      - `(kind: String)`
    - `progenitor`
      - `(skill: String)`

and mirroring that, we defined

- 3 resolvers
  - 1 for the top-level query
    - `characters`
      - `(obj, { homeland })`
  - 2 for the field-level queries
    - `friends`
      - `({ friends }, { kind })`
    - `progenitor`
      - `({ progenitor }, { skill })`

At this point you might realize a big part of the architecture is provided out-of-the-box but still, the burden of the persistence layer is in our hands! We still have to let GraphQL know how to retrieve the data? Potentially making the same 3 round trips to the DB??!!!

The answer is YUP! The implementation of the resolver's code is entirely up to you, GraphQL is about almost everything else.

That said, since a few cases are not tackled specifically by GraphQL but are really common ( e.g. [n+1](../day_01/day_01.md#nested-queries-and-the-n--1-problem) or [caching](https://graphql.org/learn/caching/)) you'll find several options and third-party libraries created to provide scalable solutions for that. We'll see some of them later on this course.

#### Arguments default values

Given the previous example, what if I want to define a default value for an argument?

There you go!

```graphql
type Character {
  name: String
  surname: String
  age: Int
  homeland: String
  kind: String
  friends (kind: String): [Character!]
  progenitor (skill: String = "foresight"): [Character!]
  skill: String
}
```

#### Non-nullable arguments

Here you have!

```graphql
type Character {
  name: String
  surname: String
  age: Int
  homeland: String
  kind: String
  friends (kind: String!): [Character!]
  progenitor (skill: String = "foresight"): [Character!]
  skill: String
}
```

also, if the argument is not provided it will yield

BOOM! 💥 `"Field "friends" argument "kind" of type "String!" is required, but it was not provided."`

#### Arguments type validation

Yup, if you go:

```graphql
query {
  characters (homeland: "The Shire") {
    name
    friends  (kind: 1){
      name
    }
  }
}
```

 you'll have

 BOOM! 💥 `"Expected type String!, found 1."`

 also, many IDEs provide static code validation for some of these cases.

#### Coercing Field Arguments

In order to produce the right value for an argument it must go through a specific process. You can see how and when that happens here in the specification section dedicated to [Field arguments coercion](http://spec.graphql.org/June2018/#sec-Coercing-Field-Arguments)

## Variables

Ok, now that we've seen the tip of the iceberg, some important subjects will surface related to the real world software industry.

- reusability
- scalability
- maintainability
- security

Using arguments the way we did on the [nested query with arguments](#nested-query-with-arguments) example is nice and simple but it doesn't capture any of the items listed above, particularly because it forces us to **hard-code the arguments values** every time and because of other topics we'll see [later today](#security-and-scalability).

Sure thing, GraphQL won't stop you from creating string interpolation functions to use a query template and replace some tokens with the params values, but despite the fact that it'll increase the maintenance surface and therefore the bug introduction surface, it'll lack of several benefits GraphQL provides out of the box and several benefits derived from the variables feature itself.

So, what's this "variable" thing about?

> A GraphQL query can be parameterized with variables, maximizing query reuse, and avoiding costly string building in clients at runtime.
>
> If not defined as constant (for example, in DefaultValue), a Variable can be supplied for an input value.
>
> Variables must be defined at the top of an operation and are in scope throughout the execution of that operation.
>
> Values for those variables are provided to a GraphQL service along with a request so they may be substituted during execution.
>
> Source: [GraphQL Spec (June 2018) - Variables](http://spec.graphql.org/June2018/#sec-Language.Variables)

We could change our [nested query with arguments](#nested-query-with-arguments) example now to use **variables**. The syntax is simple, similar to query arguments but the variable names should be [valid names](http://spec.graphql.org/June2018/#sec-Names) (as any other name in GraphQL) preceded by a `$` sign

```graphql
# here's our document with a query operation using variables
query ($homeland: String, $kind: String!, $skill: String!) {
  characters(homeland: $homeland) {
    name
    friends(kind: $kind) {
      name
      progenitor(skill: $skill) {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

and here how we factored out the variables dictionary (usually JSON) to be passed along separately

```json
{
  "homeland": "The Shire",
  "kind": "half-elven",
  "skill": "foresight"
}
```

Now we can use the same operation definition and only change the variables. GraphQL will perform all validations ([Type](http://spec.graphql.org/June2018/#sec-Variables-Are-Input-Types), [nullability](http://spec.graphql.org/June2018/#example-c5959), [uniqueness](http://spec.graphql.org/June2018/#sec-Variable-Uniqueness), ...), [variable value coercion](http://spec.graphql.org/June2018/#sec-Coercing-Variable-Values) and some more things.

Before going forward we'll stop here to consider some important differences between `variables` and `arguments`.

- All variables defined by an operation must be used in that operation or a fragment transitively included by that operation. Unused variables cause a validation error. / [All Variables Used](http://spec.graphql.org/June2018/#sec-All-Variables-Used)
- Variable used within the context of an operation must be defined at the top level of that operation. / [All Variable Uses Defined](http://spec.graphql.org/June2018/#sec-All-Variable-Uses-Defined)
- A notable exception to typical variable type compatibility is allowing a variable definition with a nullable type to be provided to a non‐null location as long as either that variable or that location provides a default value. / [Allow variables when default values exist](http://spec.graphql.org/June2018/#example-0877c)

Until here we partially captured the **reusability** and **maintainability** items (we could go deeper into them but that's for another chapter ;)) but ... what about **security** and **scalability** and why are both related in this context?

### Security and scalability

Remember we mentioned about some extra benefits of defining your operations with variables instead of interpolating the strings yourself?

Having your operations **statically defined** will dramatically impact on the following items:

#### Runtime performance

You won't have to perform interpolation to build your operations in runtime, saving precious time and resources (like memory)

#### Static analysis tooling

You can use several tools during development to validate your code against the schema saving a lot of time (and money), and reduce the number of defects capturable by this kind of tools before they harm the user.

#### Declarative vs Imperative approach

Can you imagine following a large application with hundreds/thousands of operations defined as interpolation statements? That's not only hard to follow, understand and maintain, it's also impossible to scale and certainly an invitation for all bugs in the universe to come forward and rejoice. Having all your operations described up-front provides you a more predictable and safe engineering flow.

#### Security and transport overhead

Last but not least, we're now reusing the same operation but we have to send it every single time, right? ... WRONG!
Sending an operation is not only a communication overhead but is also a potential security issue!! At this point of the software engineering evolution stage we can't imagine sending an SQL query as-is on a request, is like you'd just explode if you see something like that! It turns out many applications are sending graphQL operations in a completely human readable way around the world (⊙＿⊙'). Ok, we might be over reacting but the truth is, if you don't take extra precautions, **an attacker could send down an expensive or malicious operation** (query or mutation) to degrade your performance, execute harmful actions, or — being naive — run an unexpected operation you don't really want anyone to perform.

How to solve that?

The name is **Persisted queries** and they're way beyond the scope of this training but they're absolutely worthy to mention.

#### TL;DR

Imagine a mechanism to define at development time a map to connect your operations to an identifier, this map is a contract between the client and the server so that you can perform a query defining the identifier and the variables, if the identifier is invalid so the operation will be; this way you perform only the allowed ops and also save a lot of traffic. There are several implementations of this concept, a simple [Google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=graphql+persisted+queries) will give you more info.

## Exercise

For a given datasource ([abstracted as json here](datasource/data.json)) containing `n` rows of `skills` and `n` rows of `persons` we provided a sample implementation of a GraphQL server for each technology containing:

- a server app
- a schema
- a resolver map
- an entity model
- a db abstraction

The example contains the solution for previous exercises and necessary code to run the following query operation so you can have a starting point example:

```graphql
query {
  persons(id: 4) { ## id argument is optional
    id
    age
    eyeColor
    fullName
    email
    friends {
      id
      name
    }
    skills {
      id
      name
    }
    favSkill {
      id
      name
      parent {
        id
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Exercise requirements

- Update the type definition and the resolvers to be be able to perform the query operations listed below (can you provide other sample queries when your code is completed?).
- Discuss with someone else which would be the best way to use variables and try some. (there's always a tricky question)

#### Operations list

Provide the necessary code so that a user can perform the following `query` operations (the argument's values are arbitrary, your code should be able to respond for any valid value consistently):

The typedef should declare the following behavior and the resolvers should behave consistently for the arguments' logic:

- All arguments for all queries are optional
- if a `selectionSet` name is plural, a list should be returned, otherwise a `scalar` or `Object type` ( e.g `person` -> `Person` / `persons` -> `[Person!]`)
- if an argument is not provided
  - if a single value is expected as output, return null
  - if a list is expected as output, return all records
- if and argument is provided
  - if a single value is expected as output, return match or null
  - if a list is expected as output, return matches or empty list

```graphql

## Part 01
query singlePerson{
  person(id: 4) {
    id
    age
    eyeColor
    fullName
    email
  }
}

## Part 02
query multiplePersons{
  persons(id: 4) {
    id
    age
    eyeColor
    fullName
    email
    friends(id: 1) {
      id
      name
    }
    skills(id: 47) {
      id
      name
    }
    favSkill {
      id
      name
      parent {
        id
        name
      }
    }
  }
}

## Part 03
query singleSkill{
  skill(id: 47) {
    id
    name
    parent {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}

## Part 04
query multipleSkills{
  skills (id: 4){
    id
    name
    parent{
      id
      name
    }
  }
}

```

#### Technologies

Select the exercise on your preferred technology:

- [JavaScript](javascript/README.md)
- [Java](java/README.md)
- [Python](python/README.md)
- [NetCore](netcore/README.md)

This exercise, hopefully, will generate more questions than answers depending on how deep you want to dig into reusability, scalability, performance and other topics. Here you have some extra considerations to investigate; they're beyond the scope of the exercise, but really worthy to be mentioned, of course they're NOT the absolute truth but they'll provide you some starting point to investigate further if you want.
